                                        I was born in the infamous country of Haiti, although I don't remember much of my time there, I do remember my journey to the United States. The first time I felt the plane's wheels lift off the ground, my parents described seeing a glint in my eye that has since never left. I dreamed of one day gaining my own wings and flying. I gained an animus toward the airplane's window as it kept me from feeling the air on my face. From that moment, I knew I was not meant to be earthbound.

                                        Growing up in the United States, I had limited access to the internet, so I spent most of my time exploring the world around me and picking up different skills that interested me. I was particularly known for asking too many questions. 'Why' seemed to be my favorite word. I was determined to learn as much about the world as possible. As I became older, this manifested into enjoying tinkering with things. I also became interested in space exploration and our new frontier. At this time, I played a game called Kerbal Space Program, and enjoyed the glimpse it gave me into the work that goes into space exploration. There is a huge modding community around this game, and I stumbled onto a really cool mod named "Kerbal Operating System" (kOS). It allowed you to write programs to control your rockets in real-time. It got me hooked as I was programmatically solving interesting real-time problems using concepts I had been learning in grade school and some extra-curricular learning. Eventually, I decided to learn other programming languages used in real life, such as C. As I followed tutorials, the power a computer held instantly became clear to me, and I wanted to learn everything about it and more.

                                        At some point, I wanted to know how it all came together and uncover how we got from rocks and electricity to running programs like a web browser. I delved deeper and came across videos of people building computers using Redstone in the game Minecraft. I followed along with tutorials and built my own simple binary adder in the game, and was eventually recommended an <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&si=343dXdZQaIbT36HL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-300 hover:text-blue-200 underline transition-colors duration-200">amazing video series</a> by Ben Eater. Months of obsession later, I eventually bought an Arduino and started programming and building my own circuits. Soon, programming became a part of everything I didâ€”I programmed custom LED lights and set up my own HomeLab server to learn how to self-host my own network attached storage (NAS).

                                        When I graduated high school, I was inundated with thoughts about who I wanted to eventually be. So, I decided to do everything! I enrolled in my local community college to get my Associate in Arts with a focus in Computer Science. Simultaneously, I pursued my dream of flying and started lessons at my local flight school. On August 17th, 2019, I got my solo endorsement and, per tradition, got the tail of my shirt cut.
