                            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
                                The first hurdle we had to overcome was understanding the rover and its capabilities. We had to learn how the rover was built, how it was controlled, and what it was capable of. This was a challenge because the rover was still in development and there were multiple versions of the rover. It was difficult to always track down the correct person we needed for information.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
                                Along with this it was hard even getting to work with the rover. At the time all the rovers were in use either for testing or for demonstrations. Instead, we had to work with a simulation of the rover. This was a challenge because the simulation software was not user-friendly and there lacked a lot of documentation on how to set it up and use it. <br/>
                                Our first major win was getting the Gazebo simulation to be up in the first place.
                                After our struggle in getting the simulation up and running and chasing down the different software requirements we needed, we took the time to write extensive documentation detailing how we got the different parts of the software to work together, including which version numbers we used. Hopefully this will make life easier for future teams to get started.

                            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-200">
                                Since our project was focused on making the previous attempt at the console better, we wanted to implement features rover-side and on the frontend to improve the user experience. A lot of the work we did was fixing bugs and adding quality-of-life improvements that were present in the previous version of the rover's software so that they would stop hindering us in our attempts to implement more features. Simple things like a camera failing to be found on the rover would crash the whole program and force us to restart, which was very frustrating when we were trying to test new features. We went through implementing gracious error handling and even simple things like automatically searching for a camera on another port if the default one wasn't found, that made things not fail catastrophically all the time.

                            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-300">Learning Networking</h3>
                            <p>
                                A big quality of life addition in our project was allowing the console to find rovers on the network automatically. Even though the rovers were expected to be used by school teachers and students, to set it up you had to guide them on how to login to a terminal and enter different linux commands until they found all the information they needed. To solve this we had to learn about different networking protocols and how to implement them. We ended up using mDNS broadcasting as it was one of the easier protocols to understand and use given the time we had and the toolset available to us.
